    Release A3

    Adds Sims (tm) like commands for woohooing with Pawns, including try for baby.


    How this works:
    Adds a new ThoughDef (does not effect JobDef_Loving) and JobGiver (for ui click, requires basic (like flick))
    Pregnancy is already a HeDiff defined for humanlikes; we human likes have a gestation period and the likes as do animals, in humanlikes case the default is 45.
    This is enabled "Woohoo with {Other}" (1% chance (Disabled)) and "Try for Baby {Other}" which has a 50% (Currently always) chance, which can be reduced by Fertility if defined as a capacity.

    Birds and Bees Support by Fluffy
    If Fertility or Reproduction is a defined capacity then it is the average of the two partners then multiplies it times the base chance. To have a baby, each person must be fertile and their must be at least one person with a womb.



    TODO Dice Rolls, Currently always accept and only pregnant when try for baby.

    TODO Mod Settings
    
    TODO Pregnant Prisoners should spawn baby that is also a prisoner. Needs harmony postfix patch; will need to look as Children and Families Mod to see what I need to do there as well. Likely a second patch.
    
    TODO Custom Moodlets
    
    TODO Make the surgery to install Artifical Womb available not just through dev menu.
    
    Additionally the Woohoo yeilding Babies is integrated with Children and Families mod if you prefer that child generator over random babies from the base game generator.
    
    Release Notes:
    A3:
    Major:
    Theft of beds (including prisoner beds) for woohooing in that bed. I should add a moodlet on the owners if in line of sight
    Minor:
    No Med Beds
    Allow Male Pregnancy with installed womb (Cost 3 Medicine, Skill level 8)
    Allow prisoners to be impregnated, current default is that they are not a prisoner on spawn but a "free" pawn of the mothers faction. Will need to create a Harmony Patch in A4
    
    
    A2 : 
    Major: 
    Integrate with Children and Families, may be loaded above or below; I prefer above to ensure any nonsense in the other mod always overrules
    Minor:
    Check if already pregnant in this rather than in letting the game codes mate do it after we try to make a baby. 
    this allows ui button to not show up if not pregnant.
