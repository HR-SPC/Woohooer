    Release A4

    Adds Sims (tm) like commands for woohooing with Pawns, including try for baby.


    This creates context options of "Woohoo with {Other}" and "Try for Baby {Other}" with Colonists and Prisoners

    Please "don't" create a cannibal farm.


    Integrations:
    Birds and Bees :
    Uses the Fertility Capabilities if there

    Children School and Families :
    If this mod is enabled will use that child generator over this mods random babies from the base game generator.

    Generic:
    Will Check for Capabilities named Fertility and Reproduction, which can prevent pregancy.

    Warning:
    Psychology mod will mess with this in a way that spams your logs.
    This is because Psychology tries to Start this job without using the work driver just seeing that this joy is a valid type and trying to do in in a gathering space. Yeah psychology is trying to get your pawns to woohoo a table or campfire in a public place.


    TODO Dice Rolls, Currently always accept and only pregnant when try for baby.

    TODO Mod Settings

    TODO Pregnant Prisoners should spawn baby that is also a prisoner. Needs harmony postfix patch; will need to look as Children and Families Mod to see what I need to do there as well. Likely a second patch.



    Release Notes:
    A4:
    Major:
    Animation and Motes where appropriate.
    Woohooing tables and campfires with Psychology mod is at an end, causes BaseGame log message as we have to catch in pretoils as our workdriver is skipped. This is a bug with psychology. Sorry, all i can do is make it not horrible.
    Minor:
    Bed Theft wont happen if bed has occupents because something alone the lines of "yeah that was awkward for everyone and we agreed not to do that anymore."
    WooHoo Called on Partner as well so they get the right joy.
    Moodlets!

    A3:
    Major:
    Theft of beds (including prisoner beds) for woohooing in that bed. I should add a moodlet on the owners if in line of sight
    Minor:
    No Med Beds
    Allow Male Pregnancy with installed womb (Cost 3 Medicine, Skill level 8)
    Allow prisoners to be impregnated, current default is that they are not a prisoner on spawn but a "free" pawn of the mothers faction. Will need to create a Harmony Patch in A4


    A2 :
    Major:
    Integrate with Children and Families, may be loaded above or below; I prefer above to ensure any nonsense in the other mod always overrules
    Minor:
    Check if already pregnant in this rather than in letting the game codes mate do it after we try to make a baby.
    this allows ui button to not show up if not pregnant.
