	Adds Sims (tm) like commands for woohooing with Pawns, including try for baby. 
	
	
	How this works:
	Adds a new ThoughDef (does not effect JobDef_Loving) and JobGiver (for ui click, requires basic (like flick))
	Pregnancy is already a HeDiff defined for humanlikes; we human likes have a gestation period and the likes as do animals, in humanlikes case the default is 45. 
	This is enabled "Woohoo with {Other}" (1% chanch) and "Try for Baby {Other}" which has a 50% chance, which can be reduced by Fertility if defined as a capacity. 
	
	Birds and Bees Support by Fluffy
	If Fertility is a defined capacity then it is the average of the two partners then multiplies it times the base chance.
	
	Why not children and pregnancy?
	- UI Click
	- No School
